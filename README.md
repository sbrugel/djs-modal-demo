# modal test
Just a quick project which demonstrates the Modals feature added in discord.js v13.7.0. Also demonstrates the new attachment parameter feature included with the same release.

What this features:
- Two different commands which each show a unique modal
- A response that differs based on which command was executed
- Demonstration of the various modal properties including type, and length limits
- A command that intakes an attachment and returns a reply showing its properties
